<b>How the Web Works</b><br>
The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. <br>
When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server.<br>
The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

<p>
<b>HTML</b><br>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web.<br> 
HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". This video gives a good overview.

<p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b><br>
HTML documents are made of HTML elements. <br>
When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b><br>
Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally.<br> 
This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
</p>

<p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b><br>
HTML elements are either inline or block.<br> 
Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
